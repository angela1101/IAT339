                Growing up in Virginia Beach, I always described it to people as a beach city. There was plenty of fake
                tanning, Valley girl accents and an abundance of skateboarders and surfers in the experience I had. It
                still holds a special place to me for its uniqueness and post-80's boom architecture. I’ve only surfed
                once ever, with my grandad, and ran over my brother in the water after being chased by a pufferfish.
                That ended my Blue Crush career. And with skateboarding, I’d go watch the boys I went to high school
                with skate at the big skate park, wishing I could be so brave and graceful. I would always admire the
                clothing in the surf shops my mom would take me, quietly wanting to be apart of that world.
