        <div class="con_text_con">
            Re-imagining the greeting card was a treat with Wrap. They were so open and wanted playful executions for

                    Growing up in Virginia Beach, I always described it to people as a beach city. There was plenty of fake
                    tanning, Valley girl accents and an abundance of skateboarders and surfers in the experience I had. It
                    still holds a special place to me for its uniqueness and post-80's boom architecture.
