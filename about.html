                Hi there! My name is Hsuan-Ying Chao, and I am currently a fourth-year student at SFU (Simon Fraser University). I am pursuing my passion for graphic design and media content production through my studies.
                <br>
                
                <br>
                As a creative individual, I have always been drawn to the world of design and media. I enjoy exploring new ideas and experimenting with different techniques to create visually appealing and engaging content. My studies at SFU have provided me with a strong foundation in design principles, as well as the technical skills required to bring my ideas to life.
                Throughout my time at SFU, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of design and media projects, both independently and as part of a team. These experiences have helped me develop my communication and collaboration skills, as well as my ability to adapt to different project requirements and timelines.

                <br>
                
                <br>
                Outside of my studies, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the design and media industry. I am always looking for new ways to enhance my skills and expand my creative abilities.
                In the future, I hope to use my skills and experience to pursue a career in graphic design and media content production. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and am eager to see where my passion and hard work will take me.
